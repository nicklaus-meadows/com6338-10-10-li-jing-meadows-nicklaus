# Group Project Group 2 Li-Meadows

## Project Description

This project is a space exploration-themed web application built using JavaScript, featuring data from two NASA APIs. The site includes three pages: a homepage, a Photo of the Day page, and a Near-Earth Objects page. The Photo of the Day page displays a daily astronomy image along with a description from NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API. The Near-Earth Objects page uses NASA’s NEO API to showcase a list of nearby asteroids and comets, including their size, brightness, and hazard potential.
